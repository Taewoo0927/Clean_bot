Summary of Steps
1. Created tasks.json

defined a build task to specify:

The compiler (msp430-elf-gcc.exe).
The source files (main.c and any other .c files).
The microcontroller model using the -mmcu flag (e.g., -mmcu=msp430g2553).
The include paths for the MSP430 headers (using -I).
The linker script path (using -L and -T).

2. Modified launch.json
configured the debugger settings to:

Use msp430-elf-gdb.exe as the debugger (miDebuggerPath).
Point to the compiled executable (main.elf).
Enable GDB features like pretty-printing.

3. Updated c_cpp_properties.json
You configured IntelliSense to:

Recognize the compiler (msp430-elf-gcc.exe).
Include the header paths for MSP430 (includePath).
Set the compiler arguments (compilerArgs) to specify the microcontroller model (-mmcu=msp430g2553).

4. Added Flash to tasks.json to upload code

5. Converted everything to Makefile

Simple Steps Recap:
1. Built tasks.json: Specified which .c files to include, the microcontroller, and paths for headers and linker script.
2. Modified launch.json: Set the path to the debugger (msp430-elf-gdb.exe) and the executable (main.elf).
3. Modified c_cpp_properties.json: Added compilerArgs to specify the microcontroller (-mmcu) and set the compiler and include paths.
